============================================
Project RemoteControlPC build script updated
============================================

Project build script file jfx-impl.xml in nbproject sub-directory has not been recognized
as compliant with this version of NetBeans JavaFX support module. To ensure correct
and complete functionality within this NetBeans installation the script file has been
backed up to jfx-impl_backup.xml and then updated to the currently supported state.

FX Project build script auto-update may be triggered on project open either after
NetBeans installation update or by manual changes in jfx-impl.xml. Please note that
changing jfx-impl.xml manually is not recommended. Any build customization code should
be placed only in build.xml in project root directory.

Remark: The auto-update mechanism can be disabled by setting property
javafx.disable.autoupdate=true
Automatic opening of this notification when project files are updated can be disabled by setting property
javafx.disable.autoupdate.notification=true
(in build.properties, private.properties or project.properties).

Remark: Files nbproject/jfx-impl_backup*.xml and this file nbproject/UPDATED.TXT
are not used when building the project and can be freely deleted.
